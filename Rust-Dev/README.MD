This is a collection of Dockerfile able to provide an up-to-date environment for RUST, 
with (optionally) atom editor and (optionally) cross compile tools.

You need to run build.sh once per directory (this is a long process).

order is Core
then +Atom
then +Cross

Next time , just launch run.sh in directory and follow instructions.
