This Dockerfile is here to provide an up-to-date environment for RUST, 
with atom editor.

You need to run build.sh once (this is a long process).
Next time , just launch run.sh and follow instructions.

Latest atom editor is available, together with latest stable rust compiler.
rustup is also here and arm crosscompiler is available, together with X86-static musl compiler.
